# 📘 Thesis Documentation Template (Markdown + MkDocs)

Welcome to the **Thesis Documentation Template** — a modern, modular, and GitHub-friendly way to write your thesis using:

- **Markdown** for clean writing  
- **MkDocs + Material theme** for beautiful documentation  
- **GitHub + GitHub Pages** for tracking progress and publishing  
- **GitHub Actions** for validating and deploying automatically  

This template follows a **standard academic thesis format** and breaks every section into separate Markdown files for clarity and maintainability.

# 📦 How to Use This Repository as a Template

This repository is configured as a **Template Repository** on GitHub.

If you are a student starting your thesis project, **DO NOT fork this repo**.  
Instead, follow these steps:

### ✅ 1. Click the **“Use this template”** button at the top of the repository

This will create a **brand‑new repository under your GitHub account** with the same content.

### ✅ 2. Name your repository

Example names:

- `thesis-juan-dela-cruz`
- `thesis-mary-anne`
- `capstone-group5`

Choose **Public** or **Private** depending on class requirements.

### ✅ 3. Clone your newly created repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
```

### ✅ 4. Start editing your Markdown files inside the `docs/` folder

When finished editing:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Chapter 1 Introduction"
git push
```

# 🧭 Notes for Students Who Already Forked Before This Template Was Enabled

If you already forked the teacher’s repo earlier:

### ✔ Your fork still works — you do NOT need to start over.

To receive updates from the teacher template:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Kinev10/thesis-markdown-template.git
git pull upstream main
```

If your fork is broken or outdated, you may choose to:
- create a NEW repo using the template  
- copy your existing work into the new structure
